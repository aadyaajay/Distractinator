### Project Description
Distractinator - a reverse productivity tool. A Chrome extension that detects when you‚Äôre trying to focus and immediately distracts you. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first anti-focus assistant.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People these days are a little too committed to being productive. They set goals, make lists, watch tutorials at double speed, and still feel guilty for taking a break. It's become normal to treat rest like a reward instead of a right. Some people actually stick to their routines. Clearly, we're facing a dangerous surplus of motivation. So we built The Distractinator - which makes sure that you are always on the wrong track.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Introducing Distractinator - A browser extension built with one goal, to make sure you never get anything done again (on purpose). Distractinator is your personal anti-productivity companion, designed to pop up  exactly when you're about to be responsible. Open a productive website, we pop up with "valuable" advices and a redirect to the "right" path like instagram or reddit.
It not only stops there, we detect what type of YouTube videos you are watching and "help" you if you dare to watch an educational video.
